# Project Name: 
## My-First-Data-Analysis-Repository 

-----
# Project Objective: Problem Statement
### This project aimed to give insight into the COVID19 cases all around the world, focusing on the confirmed cases, the recovered cases and the death cases.The total numbers of the confirmed, recovered and death cases, the countries with the highest numbers over the years, countries with the lowest numbers, the year and the month with the highest numbers of the various variables were analysed and visualized.  

-----
# Data Sourcing
### The data was scraped from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. It is a CSV file and was used directly from the web.
-----
# Data Transformation
### The data was transformed using Microsoft Excel for cleaning, analyzing and also visualizing. 
#### Using the Excel Power Query, the data was cleaned: adjusting the data type and changing from wide to long data. All three tables were merged (confirmed, recovered and death) to form a consolidated table for analysis. Three columns were added, to extract the years, months and days to help the analysis. 
## Pivot tables were created and pivot charts from the pivot tables.
### The pivot tables were used to gain insights into the cleaned data, while the pivot charts were used for the creation of the dashboard. 
### Insights into the total numbers of confirmed, recovered and death cases were looked into. Five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were seen and also five countries with that recorded the lowest number of cases. The confirmed cases were compared against the death cases. The recovered caeses had issues at my end and so was left out.

# Findings and Recommendations
- ### Total death is only 1.4% of total confirmed cases.
- ### Mexico and Russia recorded so many deaths even though their confirmed cases were not among the top 5 highest confirmed cases.
- ### I found out that the 5 countries with the highest confirmed cases did not exactly make it as the 5 countries with the highest death cases. 
- ### There were no recorded death cases in the Antarctica and Oceania areas which are extremely cold environments.
- ### There are no recorded deaths in both the Summer Olympics 2020 and the Winter Olympics 2022 games.
- ### There was sudden and rapid decline in cases of Covid19 and resulting deaths in 2023.

1. ## I therefore recommend that whatever was used to stop the spread of the virus and deaths be made readily available for COVID-19 patients and in energent cases.
2. ## Researchers should research into the what and how the Tuvalu and Antartica did to prevent death.
